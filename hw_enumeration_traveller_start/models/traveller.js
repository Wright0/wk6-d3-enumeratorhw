//This is sort of cheating but I found a simple way to do it using set with spread syntax.
//The idea behind set is that the items in it can only exist once. It's a set of things. It does the filtering for you.
//The ... spreads the items in the set out. Sort of allows you to see them? Access them? It puts them side by side from what I saw when I played around with it.
//The [] around it puts that into an array.
//Technically I used a map so maybe this does count...
